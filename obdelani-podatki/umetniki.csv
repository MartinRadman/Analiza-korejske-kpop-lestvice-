Composed of seven highly talented musicians picked out from numerous auditions, the performance band was expected to upgrade the public’s expectation of a boy band. Believing that fresh concepts and incomparable talents are the only means to survive in the fiercely competitive music world, the seven-member band had subjected itself to intense training. In fact, fans were able to watch their rigorous training and selection process through a documentary called Hot Blood Men on a cable channel. As a result of all that hard work,mbb they were able to make their stunning debut the summer of 2008 with unparalleled dance skills and notable singing, thus totally shattering the existing image of pretty boy bands.

Jaebum had taken to his personal myspace page in 2005 to vent about his dislike for Korea using derogatory words. This enraged Koreans who demanded for Jaebum to be kicked out of the group. A few days following the upheaval his past comments had created, Jaebum announced he would be leaving to the US. The remaining members honored his role in the group by leaving a spotlight over Jaebum's usual spot while performing and leaving his vocals untouched on the already recorded songs. Loyal fans also stuck by Jaebum, protesting that JYP bring him back to the group. Towards the end of 2010 and early 2011, there were hints of this being a possibility.    However, February 2010, JYP made an abrupt announcement that Jaebum's contract with JYP was terminated and that he would not be returning to 2PM ever again. Such a strong stance left the public wondering what could have possibly triggered the producer to make such a statement. Tot his day, fans are left in the dark.

232588,Psy,"In February 2001, a rookie singer stirred up the Korean pop music scene with very blunt lyrics, peculiar dance moves and his unconventional appearance. The rookie singer was Psy, also nicknamed the “Bizarre Singer.” With “Bird,” the title song of his first album, Psy showed off his own style, fashion and confidence successfully breaking down the stereotype among kpop music lovers that male singers have to be good-looking and be able to dance well.     His in-your-face lyrics especially appealed to the younger generation of Korean music fans. The fact that he graduated from the Berkley School of Music in the U.S. also served as a significant merit for the singer. However, just 5 months after his album was released, Psy’s album was not allowed to be sold to juveniles as various civic groups complained that it potentially is a negative influence for the younger generation. Several months later, Psy was arrested by the police on charges of smoking marijuana. In January 2002, Psy was punished with a fine.     His second album entitled “For Adults” was released in the same month and was also banned from being sold to those under the age of 18. In September of 2002, Psy released his 3rd album by launching his new music on an Internet music site. Being released just a few months after the World Cup games held in Seoul, the title song of Psy’s 3rd album, “Champion”, saw great success for its crowd-pumping vibe.    He continued to hold his spot as an artist that fans loved for his unconventional ways and refusal to adhere to society’s and the industry’s mold. Of course the inevitable came, and he went in to serve his mandatory military sentence from 2003 to 2005. However, evidence came to light that suggested Psy didn’t properly serve his full sentence. He was re-drafted to serve a second term in August of 2007. After being released the summer of 2009, Psy voiced how he had learned a lot through his experience. He said he also felt the weight of his responsibility to his wife and two daughters that were born two months before he started his second term.    Psy switched entertainment agencies in 2010 to YG Entertainment where CEO Yang Hyun-suk expressed his old time ties with the singer. Psy made his comeback in October of 2010 amidst the idol craze. However, true to form, he’s been embracing the fact that he’s nowhere close to idol status. Sticking to his usual style without the overusage of the ever-so-popular auto-tune voice synthesizer, Psy’s showing another successful run with his music.",2001,SO

Not to say that those successes will inevitably be a flash in the pan, because that’s not necessarily the case. However, something’s got to be said for the groups that slowly and steadily emerge from the bottom. The Brown Eyed Girls is an example of the latter. Seeing only moderate success with their first few songs after debuting in 2006, the music industry only really sat up and took notice with their hit “Abracadabra” in 2009. Showing off an edgier look with sexy dance moves featuring a feminine swaying of the hips, the BEG proved to be a force to be reckoned with.  One by one, the members of the group started embarking on solo activities. Whether it be being featured on variety programs, hosting their own radio shows, or debuting as a solo artist, BEG started to be recognized as separate entities.   Ga-in in particular became very popular thanks to the show “We Got Married”. She was paired up with 2AM’s leader, Jo-kwon in a pretend marriage. The couple was immediately well-received by the public and were nicknamed the “Ad-am Couple” because “ad-am” in Korean means cute and small. With the show’s help, the couple released a catchy duet called “We Fell In Love”. Fans couldn’t get enough of it, boosting its rankings into the top tier of the music charts.  Ga-in then decided to go fully solo, not long after fellow BEG member Narsha had a successful run with her own solo activities. Not much after releasing her first single “The Undoable”, Ga-in’s song became number one on the Gaon online music charts. She also took home the crown for a live music performance show in Korea, demonstrating her popularity.  “The Undoable” has been praised for fusing unique and different genres of music: electronic and tango.

232820,Dynamic Duo,"Dynamic Duo, one of the biggest names in Korean hip-hop, is made up of members Gecko and Choiza, former members of the group CB Mass. The duo gained massive popularity with their first album and are known for their powerful lyrics and rapping, as well as for the diverse musical styles that they incorporate into their music.    Rappers Choiza and Gaeko are so similar they seem like mirror images of each other. Having grown up on the same block, the two have shared almost everything in their lives : memories, experiences and, most importantly, their love for music.     However, when CB Mass, the popular hip-hop group they founded with rapper and producer Curbin, disbanded after an ugly dispute, their future seemed uncertain. Still, the two lifetime buddies knew that whatever happened, they could always rely on each other. Choiza and Gaeko returned to the musical scene as a new group, the Dynamic Duo. Their debut album, “Taxi Driver,” was released on May 17th, 2004 and dispelled people’s doubts about the rappers. According to Hanteo Information System, which keeps track of local music sales records, “Taxi Driver” has sold over 50,000 copies between the release date and June 16th, 2004.     Choiza and Gaeko started out their musical careers as members of the underground hip-hop group K.O.D. Working their way up to the mainstream music industry, they were joined by Curbin to form CB Mass in 2000. According to Hanteo Information System’s estimate, their best-selling second album “Matics” has sold more than 120,000 copies in Korea.     However, at the height of their success, rumors had it that they would break up over personal issues between members, and their last album added weight to the speculation with only the two appearing on a majority of the songs. “Resume,” the intro to “Taxi Driver,” acts as a testimony to all the rumors. On it, when Gaeko raps, “He liked standing in front of mirrors than music/ He worshipped cash more than friendship/ What he left with us is only betrayal,” it’s pretty clear who he is talking about.     Gaeko said that it’s not that they wanted to blame Curbin, but without talking about him, they can’t talk about themselves. Gaeko added that Curbin is a part of the reason why he and Choiza are here as the Dynamic Duo. However, Choiza added they would like to build their own music career free from the past name recognition earned during the CB Mass era.     On their debut album, the Dynamic Duo takes the genre of rap to the next level by incorporating storytelling elements, which they said is their boldest change from the past.     On “Two Men,” among other tracks, the duo rap about a father who is about to be laid off from his job and a boy who ran away from home after having been beaten by his father. “Tragedy Pt. 1” is a fictional touch about a young girl who seeks revenge on men after becoming infected with AIDS from her first sexual relationship.     Another big change, is that they tried to put together an expanded range of music, such as rock and house, rather than solely depending on samples from old soul music. But they said old-timers like Al Green, Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye are still their favorites, which is well reflected throughout the album.     The hip-hop artists added they are not so happy about the recent surge in popularity of rap music in Korea thanks to some radio-friendly rap musicians like Cho PD and MC Mong.    The two promoted their debut album mainly by performing at clubs and concerts as well as by playing their music video on cable TV, but they drew the line at going on television, especially entertainment shows. This all changed, especially after they returned from their military duties. Now they frequent some of the hottest variety TV programs regularly.    The two are not only known for producing great music under their own names, but also for producing other great  hip hop acts. Case in point, acting as a mentor, they helped to groom another representative hip hop duo, Supreme Team. They also helped find Amoeba Culture, home to the likes of Tiger JK, Yoon Mi-rae or t, and Supreme Team.",2004,SO

Where in the world did he come from?” Fans have been voicing that he could play a strong role in popularizing hip hop more in Korea. Critics – or antis as we call them in Korea – have been saying he’s like an underground rapper who’s now playing the role of a comedian to get some limelight.  It may seem like San E became an overnight sensation, but the truth of the matter is that he spent many years perfecting his craft. Having immigrated to Atlanta in the US, San E grew up immersed in hip hop. More specifically what’s being dubbed “the dirty south style hip hop”. San E reached a fork in the road when he was a student at the University of Georgia. After contemplating on pursuing an office worker job within his major (Graphic Design), San E ultimately realized that he’d regret it if he didn’t pursue his passion in music. So he did.  He started uploading some of his music onto Korean websites where it caught the eye of Korean artists. Some big names, albeit underground names, started contacting him for collaborations. Names like Verbal Jint and Swings.   He was soon picked up by JYP Entertainment, a company that many aspiring singers would sell their souls to get into. As the first rapper to emerge out of the talent agency, San E started garnering a lot of attention through his teaser photos. One featured him standing by Park Jin-young holding a gorilla doll (Park Jin-young has always been compared to a gorilla). Another featuring his fellow JYP artists such as Jo-kwon from 2AM, the Wonder Girls, and miss A.   When his music hit stores, people were swept up in his catchy, truthful, and humorous lyrics, which made references to the likes of Tiger JK and Outsider. His title song, “Delicious San” actually criticizes the k-pop industry saying that it’s flooded with idol stars that overuse the “auto-tune” or voice synthesizer. His music video featured parody clips of popular variety shows in Korea and even politician Heo Kyeong-young.   The real clincher that signaled his strong start as an artist was when he beat out all other hip hop acts in Korea and won the Hip Hop Award at the Korean Music Awards.  San E promised to always deliver rap that’s “delicious”, refreshing, and cheerful. Let’s see if he lives up to that promise.",2008,SO

234315,BEAST,"These six guys have come to write a new chapter in the history of idol K-pop stars. Beast had been the center of attention even before their official debut in October. This was due to their reality series covered by MTV, which followed the guys from the beginning even before their debut. The series showed the rigorous training process and the boys' behind the scenes goofiness, which the audience loved. Years of hard training had toughened them up as serious musicians with enough musical skills and maturity to dominate the current idol music market. For some time, they were actually known as the ""recycled group"" because many of them failed in making it into other hit groups or had already debuted to disappointing results. For example, Hyun-seung was one of the finalists to become a member of Big Bang, but got cut at the last minute. Doo-joon was also a finalist in the last round of the 2AM/2PM group before getting dropped. Ki-kwang had debuted earlier as solo singer AJ, but unfortunately didn't become the hit that his management had hoped. A number of influential musical producers came together to make Beast’s debut album, with the Beast members themselves having contributed in the album-making process by writing lyrics and raps.     Though Bad Girl was a popular song, each comeback track the guys released became a bigger hit than before. Their next mini-album featured the song ""Shock"" which won them their first #1 on the TV music ranking/performance shows. Some of the members started to get outside offers to participate in variety shows and dramas. Doo-joon became a fixed guest on the show ""Danbi"" while Ki-kwang was asked to be on the show ""Hot Brothers"". Doo-joon even got the offer to act in ""All My Love"" alongside one of his best friends, Jo-kwon of 2AM.    The boys prepared long and hard for their next comeback, seeking to perfect each track. They released a two part release with the first mini-album featuring the single ""Soom"" or ""Breath"". That song won them their first #1 on a non-cable TV music ranking/performance show, beating the group 2NE1 who had been dominating the #1 spot for weeks. It was a hit song although critics did say it was too similar to ""Shock"". They soon released the second half batch of songs featuring the title track ""Beautiful"" which was completely different from their previous songs. It showed the cute and fun side of the guys rather than the intense, serious, and powerful side that their previous songs pulled out.    Between all this, Beast started to promote abroad, winning over fans abroad as well.    The guys achieved their short-term goal as musicicans which was to hold their own concert in December of 2010. It was a sold-out concert that had ticket sellers placing them in the ranks of Big Bang and TVXQ. Their agency decided to hold an encore concert in February which was just as much of a success.    In May of 2011, the group released ""Fiction"" off of their first ever full-length album.",2009,SO

In fact, he actually used to be in a dance group called SRD (for Singing, Rapping, and Dancing) with Super Junior member Eunhyuk in elementary school. Kim soon went on to sign with SM Entertainment in 2000.    Even pre-debut, Kim got snippets of public attention, but his real launch came in 2003 when he debuted as a member of TVXQ, a group that arguably became one of the biggest, most recognizable idol groups in Korea. His stage name XIA (pronounced shee-ah), stems from him wanting to be a star not only in Korea, but one that would be recognized in all of Asia. Xia is basically ""Asia"" without the ""A"".     It seemed that nothing could stop TVXQ. They were on fire! However, in 2009, three members (Kim Junsu, Kim Jae-joong, and Park Yoochun) filed a lawsuit against SM Entertainment on the grounds of the contract terms being too long and not in the interest of the artists. Ultimately, the Seoul Court ruled in favor of the three members, and they were able to break off and sign with another agency, as long as they didn't promote under the name TVXQ.    Thus in 2010, JYJ (for Junsu, Yoochun, and Jaejoong) was born. Though the trio definitely did face their share of trouble in getting things off the ground, they slowly started to make a name for themselves outside of SM.    Junsu also started acting in musical in 2010, with his debut project ""Mozart"". He continued with a steady stream of projects for the next few years, earning the Popularity Musical Award for three years in a row.

232715,BoA,"BoA is one of the most popular singers both in Korea and Japan. At the tender age of 24, she was already considered a 10-year veteran! She was picked up as a singer by SM Entertainment at the age of 12 when she tagged along with her older brother who was actually the one auditioning! The biggest power of BoA’s success is known to be her powerful talents in both vocal and dance along with her fluency in Japanese and conversational fluency in English. Although she was only at the age of 12, her debut had been two years in the making covering everything from not only the basics of singing and dancing, but acting too. Her debut album in 2000 focused on appealing to older teenage fans through various rhythmic dance numbers was a huge success in Korea putting BoA at the top in just a matter of days after its release.     However, her popularity didn’t stop there. In 2001, she advanced into the Japanese market catering her style especially for the Japanese listeners. Unlike other Korean singers around that time who temporarily visited Japan to simply introduce their songs on a short-term visit, BoA shifted focus to give her all in adapting to Japan and searching for ways to meet the demands of pop music lovers there. Her efforts proved to be a success because by the end of 2002,  BoA was selected among the top 15 pop musicians in Japan. In the same year, she also received the golden artist award at the Best Hit Song Awards. Since her successful debut in the neighboring country, BoA has been busily going back and forth from Korea to Japan throughout her singing career. She tried to regularly release albums both in Korea and Japan, not to mention the countless singles. She has bragging rights as the only non-Japanese Asian to have two million-selling albums in Japan and one of only two artists to have six consecutive number-one studio albums on the Oricon charts since her debut. In 2004, she even released a few songs in Mandarin-Chinese.    However, once again, this all wasn’t enough. Having been dubbed “Asia’s Star” due to her strong influence in Asia, she decided she wanted to conquer the biggest pond out there: the US music market.  She teamed up with producer Thomas Troelsen to release the song “Eat You Up” which dropped online in the US in October of 2008.  Rather than releasing a hard copy of the single, SM Entertainment decided to release a promotional CD containing dance remix versions of “Eat You Up”. The track soon became a number one breakout on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. A remix version featuring American rapper Flo Rida was produced, but unfortunately leaked on the web in December of 2008.  She followed up her moderate success with her first English album in March of 2009. She headlined as one of the performers for the San Francisco Pride Festival alongside Solange Knowles and The Cliks. She didn’t stop there as she then released a repackaged English album that following August containing two new songs.    Not forgetting to cater to her Asian fans along the way, she released a new single in Japan before starting to prep for her long-awaited comeback in her home country: Korea. Just in time for her 10 year anniversary, BoA returned to the Korean stage in August of 2010 with her sixth album Hurricane Venus. Her comeback was around the time many other experienced singers were planning to break their hiatus as well, such as Se7en and Hwanhee. Korean fans were looking forward to seeing Asia’s Star do something that not many other singers out on the market could handle: singing and dancing live. And doing both well. Not surprisingly, BoA has since been climbing up the music charts with her comeback songs, and even took the number one spot on various music performance shows. And unlike most other singers who feature on variety programs to increase their popularity, BoA has refused to show her face on the small screen for such programs. She claims that she’s not funny enough to appeal to tv-viewers in that type of a setting.",,SO
